# **Loot Rules**
</div>

<div class="container-two-body" markdown="1">
 1. Each raider submits a list assigning a value to each piece of gear they want from a raid. The submission lists will be divided by Tier 4+5 (Karazhan, Gruul, Magtheridon, Tempest Keep & Serpent Shrine Caverns) and Tier 6 (Hyjal, Black Temple, Zul’Aman & Sunwell)

 2. These lists are compiled into a master spreadsheet. This master sheet lists all of the players who desire a piece of gear and ranks them from the highest to lowest value assigned. Once a loot list is submitted and approved you will get access to the mastersheet where you will be able to see what your position for each item is.
 
 3. The value of items will change from depending on attendance, guild rank and bad luck protection. 

 4. When a piece of gear drops in the raid, the person who is ranked first (highest calculated points) for an item is awarded said item. If the person is not in raid or they wish to pass, the next ranked person is awarded the item and so on. 
If there is a tie then you will have a roll-off between those people to break the tie. When an item is not on anyone’s list, it then the item goes straight to open rolls.

 5. Recipes: First drops of recipes will go to dedicated players, second drops will be /roll amongst those who have the relevant profession.

 6. Item values get calculated in by the following formula:
 
 > **Final Item Value = Personal Value + (Attendance) + (Bad Luck Protection) + (Rank bonus)**
