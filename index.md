# About
</div>

<div class="container-two-body" markdown="1">
We are newly formed guild in the wakes of The Burning Crusade. We aim to have relaxed and fun raid and guild atmosphere with good banter, but also being prepared and focused, especially during progression raids. Our goal is to clear all the raiding content in the Burning Crusade, each tier as it is relevant and have fun along the way. There will be no speed-runs, no tryhard raids, but some good steady progression. We will wipe on bosses without getting frustrated (we won't lose world buffs anyway yay!). We will improve each time, we might make mistakes, but won’t hold grudges.

We will be prepared with food buffs, guardian and battle elixirs or flasks on every boss attempt unless told otherwise. If you run out of consumables - ask in the raid, we want to be the kind of guild that helps each other, but no one likes a leech! Help each other out and respect every member of the guild. The strength of a guild and community relies on the bonds between players – together we will be awesome!
